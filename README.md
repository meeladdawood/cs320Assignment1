## CS 320 Assignment 1 
**Description:** 
This assignment is an implemention of string tokenization. This assignment consists of _six_ programs. The programs are labeled ***prog1_1.c*** ... ***prog1_6.c*** Each program is a conituation of the pervious program but with more features and constraints.
#### prog1\_1
**Description:** 
This program will read from the STDIN a string. The input string will then be parsed on spaces, after the string has been tokenized. Each token will be printed on a new line surrounded by an equal sign (=) on each end.

**Constraints:**
* The input String cannot be more than 65 characters, any extra characters will be ignored.

**How to compile/run:**
```
//Compiling
gcc prog1_1.c -o prog1_1

//Running
./prog1_1
User Input Goes Here

``` 

#### prog1\_2
**Description:**
This program will prompt the user for a String with a right caret("> "). The input string will then be parsed on spaces, after the string has been tokenized. The program will either idenitify if the token is a String by printing out "STR " or an integer by printing out "INT ".
 
**Constraints:**
* The input String cannot be more than 65 characters, any extra characters will be ignored.

**How to compile/run:**
```
//Compiling
gcc prog1_2.c -o prog1_2

//Running
./prog1_2
User Input Goes Here

```

#### prog1\_3
#### prog1\_4
